Online shopping has become increasingly popular over the years, with more and more people preferring the convenience of browsing and purchasing items from the comfort of their own homes. As a result, online retailers have access to vast amounts of transactional data, which can be analyzed to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. One popular technique for analyzing this data is **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)**.

## Market Basket Analysis

It works by identifying patterns in transactional data to uncover associations between items that customers frequently purchase together. These associations can provide valuable insights into customer behavior and can be used to inform marketing strategies and improve the overall customer experience.
