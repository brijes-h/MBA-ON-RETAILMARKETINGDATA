# MBA on Online Retail Dataset
Online shopping has become increasingly popular over the years, with more and more people preferring the convenience of browsing and purchasing items from the comfort of their own homes. As a result, online retailers have access to vast amounts of transactional data, which can be analyzed to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. One popular technique for analyzing this data is **Market Basket Analysis (MBA)**.

## Market Basket Analysis

It works by identifying patterns in transactional data to uncover associations between items that customers frequently purchase together. These associations can provide valuable insights into customer behavior and can be used to inform marketing strategies and improve the overall customer experience.

## Association Rules
Association rules in marketing analytics are a way to identify the relationships between different items or products that customers tend to purchase together. It is a type of data mining technique that allows marketers to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. Three common measures of the same are:
- Support
- Confidence
- Lift

## Apriori algorithm
The Apriori algorithm uses frequent itemsets to generate association rules, and it is designed to work on the databases that contain transactions. With the help of these association rules, it determines how strongly or how weakly two objects are connected. This algorithm uses a breadth-first search and Hash Tree to calculate the itemset associations efficiently. It is the iterative process for finding the frequent itemsets from the large dataset. It is mainly used for market basket analysis and helps to find those products that can be bought together. It can also be used in the healthcare field to find drug reactions for patients.
